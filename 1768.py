"""1768. Merge Strings AlternatelyEasy2.7K48companyAmazoncompanyApplecompanyGoogleYou are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.Return the merged string. Example 1:Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"Output: "apbqcr"Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:word1:  a   b   cword2:    p   q   rmerged: a p b q c rExample 2:Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"Output: "apbqrs"Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.word1:  a   b word2:    p   q   r   smerged: a p b q   r   sExample 3:Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"Output: "apbqcd"Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.word1:  a   b   c   dword2:    p   q merged: a p b q c   d Constraints:1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters."""class Solution(object):    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):        """        :type word1: str        :type word2: str        :rtype: str        """        list1=[]        list1[:] = word1        list2=[]        list2[:] = word2        result=""        while len(list1)>0 and len(list2)>0:            result=result+list1[0]+list2[0]            list1.pop(0)            list2.pop(0)        if len(list1)== 0 :            result = result +"".join(list2)        else:            result = result +"".join(list1)        return resultword1 = "abc"word2 = "p"solution = Solution();print("hello")print(solution.mergeAlternately(word1,word2))
